### Introduction
COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the novel coronavirus, first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China.

The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, exhaustion and dry cough. Some patients can experience pain, nasal congestion, runny nose, a sore throat or diarrhoea. 
These symptoms are generally mild and kick in gradually. Some people are infected but have no symptoms and donâ€™t feel ill. Most people (about 80%) recover from the 
disease without needing any special treatment. One in every six people with COVID-19 falls seriously ill and develops breathing difficulties. Old people and those with 
other health conditions like high blood pressure, heart disease or diabetes, are the most likely to develop serious symptoms. People with fever, cough and breathing 
difficulties need medical care.
